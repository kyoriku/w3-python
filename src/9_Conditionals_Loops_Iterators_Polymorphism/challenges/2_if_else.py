# Write a Python program that compares two integers a and b. If a is greater than b, print the string "a is greater than b". Use an if statement to handle the comparison.

# Requirements
# Variable `a` should be declared and assigned an integer value.
# Variable `b` should be declared and assigned an integer value lower than `a`.
# Use an `if` statement to print 'a is greater than b' if `a` is greater than `b`

# Modify value in variables
a = 5
b = 4

# Write your code here
if a > b:
  print("a is greater than b")
