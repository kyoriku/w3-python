# Python Indentation
# Fix the indentation in the code (spaces at the start of lines) to make the code run without errors.

# Requirements
# The program should output the string 'Five is greater than two!'

# Keep the code, but add indentation so that the code runs without errors and string gets printed.
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
