# Start with the given array of integers: array = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Perform the following tasks:
# Store the third value of the array in a variable named third_value.
# Store the length of the array in a variable named length_of_array.

# Requirements
# third_value should correctly reference the third element of the array
# length_of_array should store the length of array

array = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Store the third value of the array in the variable third_value
third_value = array[2]

# Store the length of the array in the variable length_of_array
length_of_array = len(array)
