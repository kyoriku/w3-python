# Keep the cars array as it is. Access the first element of the cars array and assign it to the x variable.

# Requirements
# Variable x should store the first element of the cars array.
# Use the first element's index to get the first element from the cars array

cars = ["Ford","Volvo","BMW"]

# Store the first element inside x, using the index
x = cars[0]
