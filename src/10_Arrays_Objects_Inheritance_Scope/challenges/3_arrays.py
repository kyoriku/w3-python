# Write a Python program with a "cars" array containing car brands "Ford", "Volvo", and "BMW".
# On a new line, add another brand, "Honda", to the end of the "cars" array.

# Requirements
# The array 'cars' should initially contain three specific brands: 'Ford', 'Volvo', 'BMW'.
# 'Honda' should be added to the 'cars' array.
# The final array size should be 4.

# Fill the 'cars' array with the initial 3 car brands.
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

# Add a new car brand to the array.
cars.append("Honda")
print(cars)
