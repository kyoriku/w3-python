# The capitalize() method returns a string where the first character is upper case, and the rest is lower case.

# Upper case the first letter in this sentence:
txt = "hello, and welcome to my word."
x = txt.capitalize()
print(x)

# The first character is converted to upper case, and the rest are converted to lower case:
txt = "python is FUN!"
x = txt.capitalize()
print (x)

# See what happens if the first character is a number:
txt = "36 is my age."
x = txt.capitalize()
print (x)
