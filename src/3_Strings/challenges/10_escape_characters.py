# Use \n in a string to print "Hello" and "World!" on separate lines.

# Requirements
# The 'txt' variable must include 'Hello', 'World', and a newline character '\n'.
# Printing 'txt' results in 'Hello' and 'World!' on separate lines.

# Modify the string below so that "World!" gets printed on a new line 
txt = "Hello \n World!"

# Printing the result
print(txt)
