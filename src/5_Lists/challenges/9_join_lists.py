# Create a Python program that joins two lists and stores the result in a new list named list3. Each list should contain exactly three elements.

# Requirements
# list1 must have three elements.
# list2 must have three elements.
# list3 must correctly combine list1 and list2.

list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

# Combine the lists
list3 = list1 + list2
