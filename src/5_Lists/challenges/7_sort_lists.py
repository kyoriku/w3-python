# Write a Python program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order. The given list is [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]. You need to sort the list using the built-in sort method and ensure that the changes are reflected in the list itself.

# Requirements
# The first line of code that initialises the list, is unchanged.
# The list should be sorted in place to be in ascending order, using the `sort()` method.
# The list is printed

# Keep this line as it is
thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]

# Sort the list in ascending order
thislist.sort()

# Output the sorted list
print(thislist)
