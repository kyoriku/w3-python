# Write a Python program that creates a new list by copying the elements of an existing list named thislist, which contains three strings: 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry'.

# Requirements
# Variable thislist should exist and have specific elements.
# Variable mylist should exist and be a copy of thislist.
# Changing mylist should not affect thislist.

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Create a new list named mylist that copies elements of thislist
mylist = thislist.copy()
