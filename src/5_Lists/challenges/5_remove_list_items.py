# Write a Python program that removes the item 'banana' from the list and then prints the resulting list.

# Requirements
# `thislist` is initialised correctly.
# The `remove()` method is used to remove 'banana'.
# After removal, the list only contains 'apple' and 'cherry'.

# Keep this line as it is
thislist = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Write your code here to remove 'banana'
thislist.remove('banana')

print(thislist)
