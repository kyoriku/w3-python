# Nested Dictionaries
# A dictionary can contain dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.

# Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
print(myfamily)

# Or, if you want to add three dictionaries into a new dictionary.

# Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}
myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}
print(myfamily)

# Access Items in Nested Dictionaries
# To access items from a nested dictionary, you use the name of the dictionaries, starting with the outer dictionary.

# Print the name of child 2:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])

# Loop Through Nested Dictionaries
# You can loop through a dictionary by using the items() method like this.

# Loop through the keys and values of all nested dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

for x, obj in myfamily.items():
  print(x)
  
  for y in obj:
    print(y + ':', obj[y])
