# If x = 5, what is a correct syntax for printing the data type of the variable x?
print(type(x))

# The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?
# x = 5
# print(type(x))
int

# The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?
# x = "Hello World"
# print(type(x))
str

# The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?
# x = 20.5
# print(type(x))
float

# The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?
# x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print(type(x))
list

# The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?
# x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# print(type(x))
tuple

# The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?
# x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}
# print(type(x))
dict

# The following code example would print the data type of x, what data type would that be?
# x = True
# print(type(x))
bool

# Which is NOT a legal numeric data type in Python:

# Insert the correct syntax to convert x into a floating point number.
x = 5
x = float(x)

# Insert the correct syntax to convert x into a integer.
x = 5.5
x = int(x)

# Insert the correct syntax to convert x into a complex number.
x = 5
x = complex(x)

# What will be the result of the following code:
# print(int(35.88))
35

# What will be the result of the following code:
# print(float(35))
35.0

# What will be the result of the following code:
# print(str(35.82))
35.82
