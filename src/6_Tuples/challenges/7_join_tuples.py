# Join these 2 tuples into a new tuple named tuple3, using the + operator.

# Requirements
# Keep the two first code lines as they are
# `tuple3` is the result of joining `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
# The `+` operator is used to join the two tuples into `tuple3`

tuple1 = ('a', 'b', 'c')
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

# Join/concatenate the tuples
tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
