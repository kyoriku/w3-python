# Create a Python program that demonstrates how to define a single item tuple correctly.

# single_item_tuple should be a tuple containing a single string element 'apple'.

# Requirements
# `single_item_tuple` should be of type 'tuple'.
# `single_item_tuple` has just one item 'apple'.

# Define the sigle item tuple
single_item_tuple = ("apple",)

# Leave this line as is
print(type(single_item_tuple))
