# Unpack a tuple of fruits into three variables 'green', 'yellow', and 'red'.

# Requirements
# Tuple unpacking is done correctly
# The variable green should be 'apple'.
# The variable yellow should be 'banana'.
# The variable red should be 'cherry'.

# Keep this line as it is
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Unpack the tuple into three variables
(green, yellow, red) = fruits

# Printing the variables
print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)
