# Use the variable x with value 5.
# Use the bitwise AND assignment operator (&=) with a number so that the value of x is 1.

# Requirements
# Keep the code line `x = 5` like it is.
# The value of `x` should be 1 after you do a bitwise AND assignment `&=` with a number.

# Keep this line as it is
x = 5

# Use the &= operator with a number so that the value of `x` is 1
x &= 1

print(x)
