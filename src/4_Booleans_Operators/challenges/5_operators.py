# Use the bitwise left shift assignment operator (<<=) to multiply the variable x with a power of 2, so that x is 16.

# Requirements
# Leave the line `x = 1` like it is.
# Variable x should be 16 after the `<<=` operation.

# Keep this line as it is
x = 1

# Use the left shift operator "<<=" so that x is 16
x <<= 4

print(x)
