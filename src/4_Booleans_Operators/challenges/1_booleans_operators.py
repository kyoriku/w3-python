# Write Python code that evaluates if a is greater than b and assigns the result to a variable named 'result'. Then, assign the opposite value to 'inverse_result'.

# Requirements
# Variable 'result' should be a boolean.
# The value of 'result' should be True.
# Variable 'inverse_result' should be a boolean.
# The value of 'inverse_result' should be False.

# Write Python code that evaluates if a is greater than b and assign to result variable
a = 5
b = 3
c = a > b

result = c

# Assign the opposite of 'result'
inverse_result = not c
