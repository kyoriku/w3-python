# Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

# Addition
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)

# Subtraction
x = 5
y = 3
print(x - y)

# Multiplication
x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y)

# Division
x = 12
y = 3
print(x / y)

# Modulus
x = 5
y = 2
print(x % y) # Modulus returns the remainder of the division

# Exponentiation
x = 2
y = 5
print(x ** y) # same as 2*2*2*2*2

# Floor Division
x = 12
y = 5
print(x // y) # the floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number
