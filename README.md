## Overview
This repository documents my journey through the W3Schools Python tutorial, containing hands-on exercises that progress from fundamental programming concepts to more advanced Python features. Rather than just reading about Python syntax, these files represent active learning through code, and each script demonstrates core concepts like variables and control flow, builds toward practical applications, and serves as a reference for future projects.

This tutorial serves as one component of my comprehensive Python learning approach, providing practical reinforcement of core programming concepts through hands-on application.

What sets this collection apart is its structured progression and practical focus. Starting with the basics of Python syntax and gradually introducing more complex topics, the exercises are designed to reinforce learning through repetition and application. W3Schools tutorial structure provides excellent scaffolding for building Python proficiency, making this an ideal resource for anyone looking to develop solid programming fundamentals.

## Contents
Each file in this repository covers specific Python programming concepts, organized to follow the W3Schools tutorial progression:

The files are numbered and named to reflect both their order in the tutorial and the concept they demonstrate. Starting with basic syntax and building toward more complex topics, each file is self-contained and focuses on demonstrating specific Python concepts through practical examples.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these Python scripts, you'll need Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer. If you haven't installed Python, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyoriku/w3-python.git
```

Navigate to the repository folder:
```bash
cd w3-python
```

You can then run any of the Python files with:
```bash
python src/section/category/filename.py
```

Or explicitly use Python 3:
```bash
python3 src/section/category/filename.py
```

For example, to run the hello world script:
```bash
python3 src/0_intro/challenges/1_hello_world.py
```

### Repository Structure
Files are organized by tutorial section and type:
- `tutorials/` - Core concept demonstrations and examples
- `exercises/` - Quiz-style questions and answers  
- `challenges/` - Hands-on coding exercises
- `methods/` - Built-in method demonstrations

## Learning Goals
These exercises help build hands-on experience in the following areas:

- Understanding Python syntax, indentation, and basic structure
- Working with variables, data types, and basic operations
- Implementing control flow with conditionals and loops
- Creating and using functions with parameters and return values
- Managing data with lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- Handling user input and file operations
- Understanding object-oriented programming concepts
- Applying error handling and debugging techniques
- Building practical applications using Python fundamentals

## Learning Tips
- **Execute Every Example**: Run each script to see the concepts in action
- **Experiment with the Code**: Modify variables and parameters to understand their impact
- **Build Upon Previous Concepts**: Later exercises often incorporate earlier topics
- **Read the Documentation**: Use the official Python docs alongside these examples

## Notes
This is a personal learning repository. The code examples are designed for educational purposes and follow the W3Schools tutorial structure. Each file builds upon previous concepts, so it's recommended to work through them in order for the best learning experience.

## Acknowledgments
The exercises in this repository are based on the Python tutorial available at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). W3Schools provides an excellent structured approach to learning Python with clear explanations and practical examples. I highly recommend their tutorial series for anyone beginning their Python programming journey.
